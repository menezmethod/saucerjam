# Changelog

## 1.3.0 — 2026-09-12

- Added a Suno v6 original soundtrack.
- Replaced on-screen mobile controls: a floating arcade-style joystick for movement (appears wherever you first touch), and tap-to-fire -- touch the arena where you want to shoot instead of a dedicated Fire button, matching mouse aim-and-click on desktop.
- Fixed two real touch input bugs uncovered by the rewrite: lifting the movement thumb no longer stops fire from the other thumb, and touching a movement control no longer wiped independent mouse aim.
- Decluttered the HUD on every device: non-essential chrome (brand, connection status, round subtitle, the move/fire hint) now dims after a few idle seconds of flight and snaps back instantly on input or taking damage. Hull/Energy, weapon selection, the clock, and Menu always stay fully visible.
- Moved Arena/Scores/Sound off the touch play screen into the existing Flight menu; weapon selection is icon-first on touch.
- Fixed a hit-test bug where the joystick's drag zone silently swallowed taps meant for HUD buttons underneath it, and a landscape-viewport layout bug where the radar overlapped the vitals panel.
- Verified 85 unit tests and 13 browser tests, including real dual-touch input (simultaneous joystick drag + independent tap-to-fire) and both portrait and landscape mobile viewports.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-09

- Replaced public map selection and rotation with Confluence: one connected 120×120 world with industrial, forest, rail, and ice districts.
- Preserved tight core combat; connected districts have two border crossings for flanks.
- Server-authoritative territory unlocks at 3/5/7 humans after five seconds. Bots do not unlock territory; shrinking waits until safe round respawn.
- Practice exposes all four districts. District status appears in the HUD. Current movement, camera, and weapon economy are unchanged.
- Verified 80 tests, two native browser clients plus five sockets, synchronized expansion/reset, weapon energy, and mobile practice. Bespoke art and human population-balance tuning remain future work.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-09

- Added Junction, an optional close-quarters map using existing Foundry art: offset central cover, side fighting pockets, and clear flanking routes. Select it explicitly; existing default map rotation is unchanged.
- Added a usage-aware mini-release workflow and reproducible runtime packaging.
- Verified 75 tests, connected movement space and spawn exits, 2/4/8-bot comparisons, and independent native-browser two-client selection/replication.
- Critic approved an opt-in first iteration. Human balance, grenade escape playtesting, and low-end performance remain open; this is not the final art/WOW milestone.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-09

First playable release of the rebuilt SaucerJam.

- Four arenas, stable overhead camera, screen-relative movement and independent aiming.
- Authoritative multiplayer for up to eight players per room, private invites, bot fill, and reconnect recovery.
- Laser bursts cost 25 energy; long ricochet bolts cost 50; grenades cost 100, travel at most 20 meters, and allow one active grenade per pilot. Shared energy regenerates at 24/second.
- Grenade blast cover, stronger explosion flashes, overhead hull indicators, match recaps, and persistent pilot records.
- Single Node server and multi-architecture Dockerfile; configurable room/connection admission limits.

Known limits: room state is in memory, deployments interrupt matches, pilot identities are browser-local, and rankings require a persistent single-writer volume. Cosmetic overlap around cover remains under investigation. Portals, pickups, and larger arenas are planned for later releases.
